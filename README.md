# ITECA E-Commerce Website
This project focuses on key web technologies and tools for web application development and the essentials
of e-commerce. Instead of giving students a specific project to replicate, students are given the freedom to
decide on a project idea or choose what they would like to build or develop. Students are thus expected to
identify a potential local client (e.g., a large or small organization) and develop an e-commerce website for
the client.
Students are also expected to conduct requirement analysis, gather all information related to their specific
client, and formulate a project proposal. Thereafter, build a database-driven e-commerce website, utilizing
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL to meet the client's needs or requirements.
